# Customer Satisfaction & Loyalty Analysis for OmniRetail

### #DataDNA July Challenge Submission

## üìù Project Introduction

This repository contains my submission for the **#DataDNA July Challenge** hosted by **Onyx Data**. The project involves a comprehensive analysis of a customer satisfaction dataset from OmniRetail, a U.S. electronics and smart home retailer.

The primary objective was to step into the role of a data analyst, using Power BI to transform a year's worth of customer feedback into actionable business intelligence. The final report identifies key factors influencing customer satisfaction and loyalty across different regions, demographics, and support experiences.

## üéØ Key Business Questions

The analysis was guided by several key questions to uncover strategic insights:
* What are the main factors contributing to high vs. low satisfaction scores?
* Are certain customer segments (by age, gender, group) more loyal than others?
* Which locations (cities or states) report consistently high or low satisfaction scores?
* Does contacting customer support negatively impact satisfaction?
* How do factors like ‚ÄúPrice‚Äù or ‚ÄúProduct Variety‚Äù influence customer loyalty?
* What is the relationship between a customer's loyalty level and their satisfaction score?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Methodology

* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Visuals:** Native Power BI visuals & advanced **ZoomCharts** Drill Down Visuals
* **Language:** Data Analysis Expressions (DAX)

**The analytical process involved:**
1.  **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Connected to the source data and performed data transformation in Power Query to handle inconsistencies and prepare the model.
2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Identified initial patterns, trends, and outliers.
3.  **DAX Calculations:** Created calculated columns and measures to derive key metrics such as average satisfaction scores, customer counts, and loyalty ratios.
4.  **Dashboard Development:** Built an interactive and user-friendly dashboard to visualize the findings, focusing on clear data storytelling.

## üìä Key Findings & Insights

The analysis yielded several critical insights into OmniRetail's customer base:

* **Top Satisfaction Drivers:** "Product Variety" and "Price" were the most significant factors influencing high satisfaction scores. Conversely, "Packaging" was a common pain point for dissatisfied customers.
* **Support Interaction Impact:** A clear negative correlation was found between customers who contacted support and their overall satisfaction score, indicating a need to improve the support process.
* **Loyalty Demographics:** High-frequency shoppers (Group A) and customers in the 30-45 age bracket demonstrated the highest levels of loyalty.
* **Geographic Trends:** The dashboard revealed distinct regional clusters. Cities in **Texas** and **California** consistently reported higher satisfaction, presenting an opportunity to study and replicate their success.

## üöÄ Actionable Recommendations

Based on the analysis, OmniRetail should consider the following strategic actions:
1.  **Enhance Product Variety:** Continue to diversify product offerings to meet and exceed customer expectations.
2.  **Improve Customer Support:** Invest in training and resources to transform the customer support experience from a negative touchpoint into a loyalty-building opportunity.
3.  **Implement Targeted Marketing:** Develop marketing campaigns aimed at demographics with lower loyalty and regions with lower satisfaction scores.
